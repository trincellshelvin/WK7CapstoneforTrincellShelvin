# Capstone Project for Trincell Shelvin
This is my week 7 Project for Capstone Repository. It will take you through various projects of mine that I have worked on and revamped during this first Cohart with updates on new things that I have created. 
You will find in this project the following: an about page that tells you about me and a little bit of my background, a gallery of images from meals created or DIY projects completed by me, edited or new coding projects created by me, and a community page as I come from a family of community organizers and volunteers where I will talk about my community ideas and philanthorpy efforts.
## About
I am from Lafayette, LA. The country girl in a big city. I started my journey going to school learning Business Information Systems with an emphasis on Web Design and coding back in 1999 where the only options for learning were hard copied books with access to a note pad and Dreamweaver to code with. We had not systems or software to help us with coding by giving us pop ups to finish like today. I count this as a blessing to be back learning this all over again with the new changes that have taken place over the years.

This project is by brain child of a culmination of that learning while getting outside of my comfort zone with some of it. You will find in the projects what I have learned from HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap (one of my favorites to use). I will be applying these techniques throughout my project to showcase my abilities.
## Projects
* Santa's Helper: This project will let the user or their children ask Santa for that one particular item that they would like for christmas. At the end of it, they will be able to print said message to Santa and mail it off to the North Pole.
* Breakfast, brunch: This project will showcase a menu for patrons to utitlize that will allow them to place a food order for brunch and breakfast items, with a message notifying them that their order is ready for pick up.
* Events-RSVP: This project will allow users to RSVP to an event and notify event coordinators or hosts of the user attending the function. It will also allow them to add their guests whom will be attending with them as well. It will also require contact information for the invited guest for confirmation.
* Events/RSVP-Meals: This project will allow users whom have RSVP'd to an event to choose between available menu items for that event, while also including any dietary or food allergy restrictions. All of these details sent to the event coordinators and/or hosts.
* Cupid's Crush: Allows a user to send someone they love or have a crush on a message letting them know about their feelings via contact means.
* New Year's Ball Drop: Is much like the Events-RSVP project, but with a difference. The user will be able to use contact means to send that special person an invite to be with them at the ball drop into the New Year.
