    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <p>This Capstone Project is a culmination of everythingt that I have learned from day one back in 1999 with my first
        go around learning HTML while studying Business Information System as my emphasis at the time was Web Design</p>
    <p>I have learned a lot during this course that I am going to subsequently showcase in several pages.</p>
